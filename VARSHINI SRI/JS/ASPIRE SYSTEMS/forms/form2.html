<!--Submitting a form normally means that the browser navigates to the page indicated by the formâ€™s action attribute, using either a GET or a POST request. 
But before that happens, a "submit" event is fired. 
You can handle this event with JavaScript and prevent this default behavior by calling preventDefault on the event object.-->
