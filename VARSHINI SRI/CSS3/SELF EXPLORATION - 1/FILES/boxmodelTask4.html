<div class="two">
    <p>The paragraph element is used to represent a paragraph of text in an HTML document. The opening tag is used to start a new paragraph, and the closing tag is used to end it. The content of the paragraph is placed between these two tags. The paragraph element is a block-level element, which means it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available. It is also a semantic element, which means it conveys meaning to the structure of the document.</p>
